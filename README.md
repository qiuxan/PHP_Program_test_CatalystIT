# PHP_Program_test_CatalystIT

This project is a PHP command line project to insert a user list into database.

It defines an object named app, this class will contain data and functions needed.

For the 1.4. Script Command Line Directives, I am not sure whether I should just present the file name, MySQL password and so on, or I should give users a way to change it. So I made an assumption to do both, as the task instructions metion. 

I also find the instructions did not mention the database name, so I make it changeable with the command -db. The database name for my localhost I used for testing is "user_info".

If you have any questions about this application, please email me at qiuxan@gmail.com
